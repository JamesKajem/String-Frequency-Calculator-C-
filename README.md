# String Frequency Calculator in C++
A fairly basic program, as far as programs go. 

# What it does
This program takes an input file (In this case being CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt), and 'tokenizes' the strings within. 
The frequency, or occurrence, of each string is recorded and can be viewed in the forms of:

A search, where the user can search for a specific word within the input file.

A printed list of all items' frequencies represented by a number value.

A printed list of all items' frequencies represented by a histogram

On exit, all formatted frequency data is outputted into a file called 'frequency.dat'

# Project Description
This project was to create a program that analyzes word frequency in an input text file, before offering a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the data with. The objective was to create a user-friendly tool to quickly analyze and present word frequency. Noteworthy strengths include the code's modularity and the presence of descriptive comments, promoting readability. Challenges were encountered in refining the tokenization logic to handle cases such as special characters. Improvements can be made in enhancing the error handling, better input validation, and refining the tokenization logic (to be fair this was my first time). Transferable skills include the modular coding, problem-solving, and effective documentation, as the code's maintainability, readability, and adaptability are showcased by its modular structure, clear user interface, and descriptive comments.
