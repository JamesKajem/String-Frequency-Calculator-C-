# String Frequency Calculator in C++
A fairly basic program, as far as programs go. 

# What it does
This program takes an input file (In this case being CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt), and 'tokenizes' the strings within. 
The frequency, or occurrence, of each string is recorded and can be viewed in the forms of:

A search, where the user can search for a specific word within the input file.

A printed list of all items' frequencies represented by a number value.

A printed list of all items' frequencies represented by a histogram

On exit, all formatted frequency data is outputted into a file called 'frequency.dat'
